  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking.
  After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.
  It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.
  It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers, and both share a lot of code.

releaseNotes: >-
  After the last update it became possible for banned users to make DNS queries over encrypted protocols. This behavior, of course, was not intended, and is fixed by this hotfix.
  We apologize for this oversight and will do our best to avoid repeating such mistakes in the future.
